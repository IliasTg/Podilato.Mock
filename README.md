ENTRY LEVEL FINANCIAL ANALYSIS Income/expenses, Profitability & Break-Even Point of fictitious Data for educational/tool-practise purposes

The study concerns the financial data of the company PODILATO.EN. The data is fictional and was created solely for training and practice purposes of certain tools, such as Excel, SQL, Python, PowerBI, and Tableau. It does not reflect real business data. The analysis was conducted in the MS Excel environment, and its graphical representation was completed using PowerBI. The entire analysis consists of this file (read.me), the Excel file (PODILATO.EN), the PowerBI file (PODILATO.EN), and the PDF (PODILATO.EN).

In order for the user to open the file (PowerBI), the relevant application needs to be installed. Otherwise, the presentation is also included in PDF format.

The company "PODILATO" engages in the following activities: It sells scooters, skateboards, and three types of bicycles (BASIC, BMX, and MOUNTAIN). It also provides repair services for bicycles, scooters, and skateboards. Scooters and skateboards are being purchased from suppliers and then sold again. On the other hand, the company manufactures all of its bicycles, purchasing and using iron, screws, and paint.

The company's expenses consist of the following: Rent, payroll, electricity, water, fixed asset purchases & repairs, scooter purchases, skateboard purchases, iron purchases, paint purchases, screw purchases.

All sources of income and expenses of the company are reflected in the "5.INCOME AND EXPENSE SOURCES" tab in the Excel file for a quicker understanding of the company's activities.

In the "1.INCOME-EXPENSE" tab, all accounting entries for the period 01/01/2023-31/12/2023 are displayed. The entries include the VAT, although its significance was not included in the current analysis.

With a net result indicating profit, a costing process was carried out to identify the most profitable activity of the company. In the "2.COSTING" tab, a breakdown of the company's expenses was performed. Using the SUMIF function, expenses were calculated by category and then distributed to income sources. Fixed and variable costs were calculated for each company activity and compared with the corresponding revenue they generated.

Using SUMIF, revenues were calculated per activity of the company, as shown in the "3.NET RESULTS BY CATEGORY" tab. Costing revealed that certain company activities were causing money losses. The results are now shown per activity after expense distribution (tab 3).

Variable costs were in each case lower than the selling price; therefore, the Break-Even Point was calculated for all activities, again in the "2.COSTING" tab. The Break-Even Point was calculated, revealing deviations for each product/service of the company.

Lastly, data visualization was conducted using PowerBI. The data was uploaded to PowerBI, where graphs were created to highlight insights, in the file: "PODILATO.PBIX". In case the user cannot open the file, they can refer to the respective PDF.
